# Carbok v1.0.0
## Application for carbohydrates management

### 1. Introduction
The idea for this project comes from personal experience when it became necessary to take care of a child with type 1 diabetes. One of the most difficult parts of diabetes management was carbohydrate counting, and initially all meals, carbohydrates, and other relevant data were recorded on paper. This helped to track the diet and receive advice from nutritionists. Still, it was difficult to memorize the amount of carbohydrates for foods and make calculations for different serving sizes. As it turned out, there was no tool that could manage carbohydrates in the same way as it was done on paper, most of the available tools were either not good enough or difficult to use with a lot of unnecessary information. The idea was born to create an app designed exclusively for calculating carbohydrates, and it was originally intended for personal use. The focus has been on making it powerful, reliable, and at the same time as simple as possible. After months of thinking, prototyping and development, Carbok was born. The results were so good that they needed to be shared with the public so that people could better manage diabetes by quickly and easily counting carbohydrates and reviewing their dietary habits.
